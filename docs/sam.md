# SAM Navigation Guide

The [**Student Achievement Manager (SAM)**](https://h100002412.education.scholastic.com/ScholasticCentral ) System is an online portal where you can:
- Access your FL Students' Lexile and Quantile Scores
- Access customized and actionable reports for your students to inform planning interventions and progress monitoring

![SAM Homepage](/_images/SAMHomepage.png)


The SAM system was designed for teachers to access Assessment scores and reports for the students in their classrooms. In order to optimize SAM for our own use, City Year has used the same structure.

# Reports {docsify-ignore}

To pull reports for your students, you will want to navigate to the reports tab.

![SAM Reports Tab](/_images/SAMReportsTab.png)

There are 2 types of reports you can pull. 
- Student Reports
- Classroom Reports

> [!WARNING] All Reports in SAM are viewable in a web browser and in a downloadable PDF. However, information provided is not always consistent between the two formats.

# Student Reports

Student reports are used to look at a **single student** at a time. 

To run a report, select the report you are interested in, and click the **RUN REPORT** button on the bottom right.

> [!NOTE] When running Student Reports, make sure you have a student selected on the left-hand panel.

## ** Reading Inventory **

### RI Report Summaries

This section will provide:
- A list of key reports available in SAM for the Reading Inventory
- Guidance on how/when to use these reports
- Definitions of key aspects of each report

#### Student Reports

- [Student Action Report](riaction.md) 
	- Gives you information about your students lexile level, and what lexile range that would either challenge your student independently or what lexile range you can use to help teach a lesson.
- [Growth Goals Report](rigrowth.md)
	- Shows the expected growth range for your students and how they are benchmarking toward reading proficiency
- [RI Recommended Reading Report](rirecommended.md)
	- Shows what books that are best fit for your student. Built based on what they are interested in and best for their reading level. 
- [Instructional Planning Report](riinstruct.md)
	- Groups your FL students according to need based on their most recent lexile score and performance level 
- [Test Complexity Report](ricomplex.md)
	- Provides lexile ranges with which to select a text for guided reading based on how much you want to challenge students 
- [Student Test Print Out](ritest.md)
	- This report will show you the student's test and the answers that the student got right or wrong. This is a good source for HMH preperation.

#### ** Math Inventory **

- [Growth Report](#mi-growth-report)
	- Shows changes in student quantile and performance level over time 
- [Instructional Planning Report](#mi-instructional-planning-report)
	- Provides recommendations for grouping students and identifies common skills and concepts students are ready to learn based on performance level

## Student Reports

### MI Student Test Printout {docsify-ignore}

This report provides questions and answers from the latest administration of the MI.

> [!TIP] **Best Practices**
> - Review the results of the assessment with your students
> - Identify trends in the types of questions students answer correctly or incorrectly.

```pdf
		files/mi_student_test_printout.pdf
```

> [!NOTE] **Key Elements**
> 1. Test info (test date, test time, number of items, student quantile)
> 2. Results of addition and multiplication screeners. If the student answered correctly within 5 seconds, the answer was considered correct. Half circles mean students may need to work on math fact fluency.
> 3. Each full test question the student received on the MI.
> 4. The correct answer, the students answer, and the time it took for the student to respond to the question.

### MI Progress to College and Career Readiness Report {docsify-ignore}

This section shows student progress towards grade level proficiency and college and career readiness. It also provides specific instructional recommendations using QSCs and State Standards.

> [!TIP] **Best Practices**
> - Identify specific skills and concepts for a selected student on your math FL.
> - Share results with partner teachers to align the skills and concepts identified by the MI with what is being taught in class.
> - Use QSC-IDs and State Standard to identify resources for planned interventions through quantiles.com or the Math Toolkit.

```pdf
		files/mi_progress_to_college.pdf
```
> [!NOTE] **Key Elements**
> 1. Dates if each adnubustratui if the MI
> 2. Results of the Math Fact Screeners
> 3. Quantile score and performance level of each testing administration.
> 4. Percentile rank that indicates the percentage of students in the dame grade level who received a lower score than the student
> 5. Specific instructional recommendations for the selected student, including if they may need to focus on fact fluency.
> 6. Provides a table of math skills and concepts that the selected student is ready to learn
