# SAM Navigation Guide

The [**Student Achievement Manager (SAM)**](https://h100002412.education.scholastic.com/ScholasticCentral ) System is an online portal where you can:
- Access your FL Students' Lexile and Quantile Scores
- Access customized and actionable reports for your students to inform planning interventions and progress monitoring

![SAM Homepage](/_images/SAMHomepage.png)


The SAM system was designed for teachers to access Assessment scores and reports for the students in their classrooms. In order to optimize SAM for our own use, City Year has used the same structure.

| SAM System |    | City Year     |
|------------|----|---------------|
| Teacher    | -> | ACM           |
| Classes    | -> | Math & ELA FL |
| Students   | -> | FL Students   |

# Reports

To pull reports for your students, you will want to navigate to the reports tab.

![SAM Reports Tab](/_images/SAMReportsTab.png)

There are 2 types of reports you can pull. 
- Student Reports
- Classroom Reports

?> All Reports in SAM are viewable in a web browser and in a downloadable PDF. However, information provided is not always consistent between the two formats.
