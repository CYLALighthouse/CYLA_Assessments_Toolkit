# SAM Navigation Guide

The [**Student Achievement Manager (SAM)**](https://h100002412.education.scholastic.com/ScholasticCentral ) System is an online portal where you can:
- Access your FL Students' Lexile and Quantile Scores
- Access customized and actionable reports for your students to inform planning interventions and progress monitoring

## Site Organization

The SAM system was designed for teachers to access Assessment scores and reports for the students in their classrooms. In order to optimize SAM for our own use, City Year has used the same structure.

| SAM System |    | City Year     |
|------------|----|---------------|
| Teacher    | -> | ACM           |
| Classes    | -> | Math & ELA FL |
| Students   | -> | FL Students   |
