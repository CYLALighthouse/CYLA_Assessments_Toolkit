# SAM Navigation Guide

The [**Student Achievement Manager (SAM)**](https://h100002412.education.scholastic.com/ScholasticCentral ) System is an online portal where you can:
- Access your FL Students' Lexile and Quantile Scores
- Access customized and actionable reports for your students to inform planning interventions and progress monitoring

![SAM Homepage](/_images/SAMHomepage.png)


The SAM system was designed for teachers to access Assessment scores and reports for the students in their classrooms. In order to optimize SAM for our own use, City Year has used the same structure.

# Reports {docsify-ignore}

To pull reports for your students, you will want to navigate to the reports tab.

![SAM Reports Tab](/_images/SAMReportsTab.png)

There are 2 types of reports you can pull. 
- Student Reports
- Classroom Reports

> [!WARNING] All Reports in SAM are viewable in a web browser and in a downloadable PDF. However, information provided is not always consistent between the two formats.

# Student Reports

Student reports are used to look at a **single student** at a time. 

To run a report, select the report you are interested in, and click the **RUN REPORT** button on the bottom right.

> [!NOTE] When running Student Reports, make sure you have a student selected on the left-hand panel.

- Definitions of key aspects of each report

## Student Reports

### RI Recommended Reading Reports {docsify-ignore}

This report provides the names of the texts within a student's lexile range, aligned with the interest areas they selected during their assessment.

Recommended reading materials will update based on the latest lexile score and newly selected interest areas on the RI.


> [!TIP] **Best practices** Sharing with your student to identify texts they will enjoy for guided or independent reading.


#### Sample

```pdf
		files/ri_recommended_reading.pdf
```

> [!NOTE] **Key Elements**
> 1. Interest areas a student selects at the beginning of the RI
> 2. Texts related to the interest areas of the students
> 3. Lexile level of each text to help identify texts that can be used at different text complexity levels.

> [!TIP]**Best Practices** 
> - Use this report to identify the lexile ranges of texts that can be used to challenge students through guided reading. 
> - Use recommended readding strategies to identify resources from the ELA toolkit for planned interventions. 


#### Sample

```pdf
		files/ri_student_action_report.pdf
```

> [!NOTE] **Key Elements**
> 1. Student's RI test history, including test dates, lexile scores, and performance levels.
> 2. Lexile ranges based on different levels of complexity for a student as well as tips for when to use texts at the specific lexile range.
> 3. Provides specific guided reading strategies for each sstudent based on lexile and student grade level. 







### RI Student Test Printout {docsify-ignore}

This report provides a printout of the latest assessment the student takes which shows both correct and incorrect responses.

> [!TIP] **Best Practices** 
> - Use this report to review the results of assessment with students. 
> - Identifying trends in the types of questions students get correct or incorrect. 
> - Use a few questions as a warm-up for session plans, or create a session plan around test preparation. 


#### Sample


```pdf
		files/ri_student_test_printout.pdf
```


> [!NOTE] **Key Elements**
> 1. Student test date, lexile score, and test time for latest assessment.
> 2. Full test questions that the student took on the RI.
> 3. Correct answers are marked with a check, incorrect answers are marked with an "x".

### RI Instructional Planning Report

This report groups your ELA FL Students according to need, based on their most recent lexile score and performance level.


> [!TIP] **Best Practices** 
> - Create small groups for ELA FL studens with similar lexile scores in order to plan intentional interventions in which multiple students can participate and maximize your T2ST time by providing interventions for multiple students at once.
