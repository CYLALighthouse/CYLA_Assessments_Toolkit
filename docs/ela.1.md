# Common Core Reading Anchors

-The next few things you will see is each standard and how it is broken down into _concrete skills_ and _academic vocabulary_, the tools that students must know to exercise those skills. 

## Standards Breakdown

- **Why focus on reading?** 

	-To be college and career ready, students must read widely and deeply from a broad range of high quality, increasingly challenging literary and informational texts. They must learn reading strategies to comprehend a given text and ultimately, identify and question what the author or speaker is saying. Therefore, more exposure to stories, dramas, poems and myths from diverse cultures and different time periods will help them widen their perspectives.

- **What are the Anchor Standards?**

	-The Common Core Standards for English Language Arts comprise both _College and Career Readiness Anchor (CCRA) Standards and grade-specific standards_. The CCRA Standards and grade-specific standards help define the skills and understandings that all students must demonstrate. CYLA uses CCRA standards for planned interventions because they provide the most essential skills for reading and learning. YOu should reference with your partner teacher for the grade-specific standard to figure out what your students should understand by the end of each grade.

-The next few things you will see is each standard and how it is broken down into _concrete skills_ and _academic vocabulary_, the tools that students must know to exercise those any reading or comprehension skills. After you have choosen the skill from your SAM page use the following steps to figure out the standard you will be working on for the next 6 weeks. 

If you have not picked a your skill from SAM please refer back to **[SAM Reports](sam.md)**

-	Step 1: Select the reading strategy you would like to focus on in left column of the chart below.

-	Step 2: Choose one of the corresponding CCRA Standards listed along the top
as indicated by an “X” in the row of your selected reading strategy.

-	Step 3: Find the breakdown of your standard in the list below and use the
Skills and Academic Vocabulary breakdown to build your objectives in your SSM.

-	Step 4: Use the resources in this ELA Toolkit to teach this standard using this reading strategy

## Reading Strategy

- Guided Reading: Small group reading program designed to help students, who are around the same reading level, with understanding what they are reading and using a variety of comprehension strategies.

	- Before Reading: After assessing the students' reading levels, the instructor finds an engaging text at their level that will help stimulate growth.

	- During Reading: Instructor helps students actively read through a variety of access and comprehension strategies. 

		- Click and Clunk: students recognize when they hit an obstacle to comprehension.

		- Word Attack: navigating and understanding unfamiliar vocabulary.

		- Talk to the Text: assissting them in posing questions and making relevant comments.

		- Other Comprehansion Strategies: visualizing the text, making connections while reading, and annotating the text.

	- After Reading: Instructors employ strategies that help students access the text and fully comprehend anything that was unclear. Students should be able to summarize the text, make inferences, and support arugment using textual evidence.
