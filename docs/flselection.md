# Focus List Selection Process

### What is a Focus List? Why Do We Do Them?

    - In any given class, students show an array of academic and socio-emotional needs​. While all students in a classroom will benefit from a near peer support an ACM will provide to the whole class, City Year corps members make the most impact by working with a small group of students so that they can provide a deeper depth of support. We call this group of 11 students, a Focus List, because it is the students ACMs focus most on in the classroom and in their small group interventions. We have found 11 students provides the best balance between the support an ACM can provide and what our state commission (AmeriCorps) thinks we are able to provide.   

### How is a Focus List Broken Up?

    - The following graphic represent how we split our students up between Math and ELA. We do it this way because it best meets the agreed upon ratios we have with AmeriCorps, while leveraging the slight edge ACMs have in ELA compared to Math.
