# Focus List Selection Process



### What is a Focus List? Why Do We Do Them?

    - In any given class, students show an array of academic and socio-emotional needs​. While all students in a classroom will benefit from a near peer support an ACM will provide to the whole class, City Year corps members make the most impact by working with a small group of students so that they can provide a deeper depth of support. We call this group of 11 students, a Focus List, because it is the students ACMs focus most on in the classroom and in their small group interventions. We have found 11 students provides the best balance between the support an ACM can provide and what our state commission (AmeriCorps) thinks we are able to provide.   

### How is a Focus List Broken Up?

    - The following graphic represent how we split our students up between Math and ELA. We do it this way because it best meets the agreed upon ratios we have with AmeriCorps, while leveraging the slight edge ACMs have in ELA compared to Math.

## Focus List Selection

    - Ineligible Candidates: In order to support students within ACM capacities and meet their needs fully, we are able to work with the following groups of students: 

        - [] ELL Level 1 & 2 Students: ACMs do not have the training and additional language acquisition to support students at these levels 

        - [] Students within certain Special Education programs: See the list here to determine if a student is eligible.  
    
    - When looking for Focus List students data is limited due to COVID. Look below to to utilize some qualitative and quatitative data pieces you may have access to.
    
### Teacher Input
    - All ACMs must meet with their teachers to identify their focus list student. In the event that teachers are unavailable, Program Managers will identify with their Program Director alternatives for teacher input and/or notification. They will take on a scaffolded approach in the following order to identify 11 (6 ELA, 5 Math) Focus List students.

#### Grades
    - We will not begin selection until 10-week grades are available for our students. Currently that is slated to be the week of October 18th. We will be looking to support students with a C (3 in elementary school marks) or lower.  
    
#### Attendance
    - Similar to previous years we will look at prior and current year attendance data to identify if they need SED support.
        - Ideal candidates are in the 86-89% Average Daily Attendance (ADA) range

#### ACM Observations
    - ACM's will observe during the first 10 weeks. They will be observing the following:
        - [] Course Performance -- ELA: ACM's will focus on observing fluency, comprehension, and vocabulary.
        - [] Course Performance -- Math: ACM's will focus on observing fact fluency, participation, and multi-digit operations.
        - [] DESSA Competencies: ACM's will focus on identifying strength and growth areas based on DESSA competencies. For more info go to [DESSA](dessa.md).
