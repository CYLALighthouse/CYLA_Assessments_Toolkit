# Changes to Focus Lists

ACMs may make changes to their Focus List until the end of the first semester with Program Manager consultation. 

Changes in the second semester must involve Program Director consultation to identify affects to pacing and/or alternative Tier 2 Support Time goals for the new focus list student.  

### Reasons for Focus List changes: 

- [] Accidental Enrollment: This is the most common exit reason. This happens when trying to enroll a student with similar names but in different grades. 

- [] ACM No longer available: ACM may have withdrawn from City Year therefore, this is the exit criteria when withdrawing by bulk or individual students.

- [] Deactivated by trigger: This commonly happens when all students in a sections has been withdrawn or a section has become inactive. 
    - When making Focus List changes make sure a student gets added first then withdraw the student with the met exit criteria. 

- [] School Year ended: This is the exit criteria for the end of the year. When Bulk withdrawing students this would be the reason for withdrawl.

- [] Student no longer available: Student may have transfered classrooms or student left a CY school.

Prior to making changes ACM and Program Manager should attempt to problem solve and set goals to improve attendance, relationship, etc. within what is in their control.
