# Clover Model

The Clover model is what City Year uses to better understand how our students interact in the world. There are Four Leaves that we view and put our students in from observations, discussions with our teachers, even from some people from administration.

The Four Clover Leaves are Active Engagement, Assertiveness, Reflection, Belonging.

Below you can use the table for each leaf where it will explain the strengths that you can use to motivate your student during an activity, challenges that you may run into when the student is interacting with others, and the do's and don'ts when working with a student in their leaf.
