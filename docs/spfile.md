# Creating Session Plans

### Step 1: Download SP file

### Step 2: Fill out the top portion of the Session Plan file:
- Students

- ACM

- DESSA Focus **Look back to Behavior toolkit for [DESSA](dessa.md) References.**

### Step 3: Write what CCSS Standard that you will be targeting for this session. 

This will be the standard that you obtained from the SAM report that you would want to focus on for the nest 6 weeks. If you need a refresher about SAM click [here](sam.md).

### Step 4: Create the Learning Objective for the day. 

**This is the main lesson that you will be teaching your student(s).** 

Step 5: List out the materials and how you would want the room to be set up for your particular group. This may be different for each group considering the modalities and DESSA strengths and weaknesses.

Step 6: Fill out the Opening portion of the Session Plan. 
- Soft Check-in: This can be a temperature check, a weather check, etc. This can be anything that you have learned from previous sessions.
	
- Expectations: These are the expectations that you and your students set for your sessions. 

- Warm-up: You want to include a light warm-up for your session that will help ground them to the lesson. You want this warm-up to relate to the topic of your lesson. If you are doing a math lesson have them do a math warm-up. If you are doing an ELA lesson you should be doing a ELA warm-up.

Step 7: Fill out the Gradual Release of Responsibility
	
- *I Do*: This is where you will be taking all of the responsibility and modeling how you would approach the lesson for the day. The student should be watching you as you complete the process. This is also the space where, if you have an Anchor chart, you will show them how to navigate the Anchor Chart.

- *We Do*: In this step both the student and you should spend the most time and practice together in solving the problems you have created for them. **Note** If you have any trick questions that you want to make your student aware of, this is where you should go over it. 

- *You Do*: This is the portion where you will give all of the responsibility to your student. You want to make this 2-5 questions, to ensure that they understood the process of finding the answer.

- *Check for Understanding and Open Ended Questions* _(CFUs/OEQs)_: Each of the above sections has another section to the right of it called CFUs and OEQs. You will want to write down questions that you want to ask your student(s). You want to make sure that they are open ended questions and they refer to check their understanding of each process. 

Step 8: Your Closing

Your closing should be short and sweet. This can be having the student summarize what they read about, or having them repeat the process that they just learned. This is time for a final check for understanding to ensure if your student(s) understood what you taught them.

_Optional_ Step 9: Reflection and SSM Commitments:

You should reflect on your session with your student(s). This is important so you can figure out what could have gone better, or what are some better practices that could work for you in future sessions. This may be from grouping of students to what content you bring to your session.
