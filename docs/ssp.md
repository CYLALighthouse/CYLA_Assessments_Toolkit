### Step 1: Download SP file

```

### Step 2: Fill out the top portion of the Session Plan file:
- Students

- ACM

- DESSA Focus 

### Step 3: Write what CCSS Standard that you will be targeting for this session. 

This will be the standard that you obtained from the SAM report that you would want to focus on for the nest 6 weeks. If you need a refresher about SAM click [here](sam.md).

### Step 4: Create the Learning Objective for the day. 

This is the main lesson that you will be teaching your student(s). 

Step 5: List out the materials and how you would want the room to be set up for your particular group. This may be different for each group considering the modalities and DESSA strengths and weaknesses.

Step 6: Fill out the Opening portion of the Session Plan. 
	- Soft Check-in: This can be a temperature check, a weather check, etc. This can be anything that you have learned from previous sessions.
	
	- Expectations: These are the expectations that you and your students set for your sessions. 

	- Warm-up: You want to include a light warm-up for your session that will help ground them to the lesson. Most likely realting to the topic of your lesson. If you are doing a math lesson have them do a math warm-up. If you are doing an ELA lesson you should be doing a ELA warm-up.

Step 7: Fill out the Gradual Release of Responsibility
	
	- *I Do*: This is where you will be taking all of the responsibility and modeling how you would approach the lesson for the day. The student should be watching you as you complete the process. This is also the space where, if you have an Anchor chart, you will show them how to navigate the Anchor Chart.

	- *We Do*: In this step both the student and you should spend the most time and practice together in solving the problems you have created for them. **Note** If you have any trick questions that you want to make your student aware of, this is where you should go over it. 

	- *You Do*: This is the portion where you will give all of the responsibility to your student. You want to make this 2-5 questions, to ensure that they understood the process of finding the answer.

	- *Check for Understanding and Open Ended Questions* _(CFUs/OEQs)_: Each of the above sections has another section to the right of it called CFUs and OEQs. You will want to write down questions that you want to ask your student(s). You want to make sure that they are open ended questions and they refer to check their understanding of each process. 



This is how you create a list:
- Bullet
- Bullet
	- Sub Bullet 1
	- Sub Bullet 2
- Bullet


This is how you **bold**.

This is how you _italicize_.

for ela.md

	- Click and Clunk: students recognize when they hit an obstacle to comprehension.

	- Word Attack: navigating and understanding unfamiliar vocabulary.

	- Talk to the Text: assissting them in posing questions and making relevant comments.

	-Other Comprehansion Strategies: visualizing the text, making connections while reading, and annotating the text.

-After Reading: Instructors employ strategies that help students access the text and fully comprehend anything that was unclear. Students should be able to summarize the text, make inferences, and support arugment using textual evidence.


##Standards Breakdown

	- **Why focus on reading?** 
	
	-To be college and career ready, students must read widely and deeply from a broad range of high quality, increasingly challenging literary and informational texts. They must learn reading strategies to comprehend a given text and ultimately, identify and question what the author or speaker is saying. Therefore, more exposure to stories, dramas, poems and myths from diverse cultures and different time periods will help them widen their perspectives.

	- **What are the Anchor Standards?**

	-The Common Core Standards for English Language Arts comprise both _College and Career Readiness Anchor (CCRA) Standards and grade-specific standards_. The CCRA Standards and grade-specific standards help define the skills and understandings that all students must demonstrate. CYLA uses CCRA standards for planned interventions because they provide the most essential skills for reading and learning. YOu should reference with your partner teacher for the grade-specific standard to figure out what your students should understand by the end of each grade.
