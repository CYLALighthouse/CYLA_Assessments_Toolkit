# The Reading Inventory (RI) {docsify-ignore}

- **What is it:**
	- The **_Reading Inventory_** is a research-based, computer adaptive assessment that is designed to measure how well students read literary and expository text at varying difficulties.

- **We use this to:**
	- Determine the students who will be on your ELA Focus List (FL)
	- Group FL Students based on common skill gaps
	- Establish attainable and realistic growth goals for students to work toward
	- Identify relevant and appropriate texts to use when building students reading and comprehension skills
	- Identify skills that support studentsâ€™ reading comprehension and fluency

!> 	RI is **not timed**. 
	Each student will answer approximately **20-25 questions**.
	Most students take **15-30 minutes** to complete one administration.
	The assessment is computer-adaptive and adjusts question difficulty based on students' responses.


?> **Computer Adaptive Design**		As students progress through the assessment, the difficulty level of questions change according to the students' performance. If the student correctly answers a question, the Lexile measure of the next question increase. If the student incorrectly answers a question, the Lexile measure of the next question decreases. The assessment ends once the student has answered a sufficient number of questions to determine an accurate Lexile measure.
