# The Reading Inventory (RI) {docsify-ignore}

- **What is it:**
	- The **_Reading Inventory_** is a research-based, computer adaptive assessment that is designed to measure how well students read literary and expository text at varying difficulties.

- **We use this to:**
	- Group FL Students based on common skill gaps
	- Establish attainable and realistic growth goals for students to work toward
	- Identify relevant and appropriate texts to use when building students reading and comprehension skills
	- Identify skills that support studentsâ€™ reading comprehension and fluency

!> 	RI is **not timed**. 
	Each student will answer approximately **20-25 questions**.
	Most students take **15-30 minutes** to complete one administration.
	The assessment is computer-adaptive and adjusts question difficulty based on students' responses.

Here is a resource that you can use to better prep your students for the HMH testing.

## Test Mechanics

The RI provides two benchmarks for FL identification and student progress monitoring.
- Peformance Bands: <font color = "red">FL Identification</font>
- Expected Growth Goals: <font color = "red">Student Progress Monitoring & Outcome Measurement</font>

**Performance Bands** 
- Align a student's lexile score with proficiency for their grade level
- Best fit Focus List student will fall under _Below Basic_ and _Basic_ Performance Band.
- Provide a benchmark for monitoring student progress toward grade level proficiency


### RI Performance Bands

**How to use this chart:**
1. Find your student's grade.
2. Find the score range from their first administration. 
3. Identify the corresponding band.
4. If the student is **Below Basic** or **Basic**, the students are <font color=green>is a better fit</font> for the ELA FL.
5. If the student is **Proficient** or **Advanced**, the students are <font color=red> NOT eligible</font> for the ELA FL.


### Expected Growth Goals

Expected growth goals for the Reading Inventory are expressed in a range of scores. 
- Growth Goal Low
- Growth Goal High

Impact Analytics uses the Growth Goal Low as the benchmark for whether or not a student met their growth goals for ACM/Team performance metrics. However, when goal setting with students, we recommend using the Growth Goal High to encourage students to challenge themselves.

!> **The Difference Between MI and RI Growth Goals** For the MI, growth goals are based on the [Average Growth Goals](#average-growth-goals) chart, and are the **same** for all students in a grade at each performance band. For the RI, growth goals are **different** for each student, even if they are in the same grade and performance band. RI growth goals can be exported from a the [RI Growth Goals Report](sam.md).

### The Lexile Framework

The RI is based on the Lexile Framework for Reading, a scientifically accurate system for:
- Matching readers to appropriately challenging and engaging texts
- Measuring the comprehension levels of readers
- Providing actionable data for identifying appropriate readings and guided reading strategies that build confidence in readers
- Providing a common frame of reference for tutors to view student performance.

?> **Computer Adaptive Design**		As students progress through the assessment, the difficulty level of questions change according to the students' performance. If the student correctly answers a question, the Lexile measure of the next question increase. If the student incorrectly answers a question, the Lexile measure of the next question decreases. The assessment ends once the student has answered a sufficient number of questions to determine an accurate Lexile measure.
