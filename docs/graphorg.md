# Graphic Organizers from ELA Toolkit

These are the Graphic Organizers that are pulled from the ELA Toolkit. You can print these out and use them for your Planned Interventions with your students. The Organizers do go in order relative to [Guided Reading](guidedreading.md), so if you need a reference to which section you need it for head back there.
