### What is the Retest Request Policy?

You may retest your students for one of the following reasons:

1. ELA: Tested in 10 minutes or less
2. Math: Tested in 15 minutes or less
3. Student score dropped 100 or more points from the previous administration
4. Logistic issues prevented assessment completion within the given time frame

### How many times does PowerBi update?

PowerBi updates every two hours and pulls up new information from the CySchoolhouse.

During HMH and DESSA windows, HMH scores and DESSA scores will be updated daily.

You can click on FY19 ACM Impact Dashboard to find when it was last updated.

## Glossary

**Computer Adaptive Testing**: A Computer Adaptive Test adapts to the students’ responses. Once a student starts the assessment questions get easier or harder according to performance, and when the computer has enough information to generate a final Quantile measure, the assessment stops. 

**Common Core State Standards**: The Common Core State Standards is a set of learning standards that provide a clear and consistent understanding of what students are expected to learn throughout the school year. The standards are designed to provide teachers and City Year AmeriCorps members with a guideline of what skills and knowledge students need, so that they can prepare students for success in the classroom. 

**Expected Growth in Lexile Measure**: The expected Lexile measure for the last administration under typical conditions based on grade level and reading achievement. 

**Focus List (FL) Student**: A student who is performing below grade level according to the Math or Reading Inventory. Each AmeriCorps member will identify eleven FL students to work with throughout the school year. AmeriCorps members will use quantitative and qualitative data to created planning documents and Session Plans to help students achieve catch-up growth.

**Knowledge Clusters**: Within the Quantile Framework, each skill or concept, referred to as a QSC builds off of and extends to others. These relationships form Knowledge Clusters

**Lexile Framework**: The Lexile Framework is a system that can help determine the reading level of any written material –from a book to a test item. The Framework can also be used to assess a reader’s reading comprehension level. After test results are converted into the Lexile measures, readers can be matched to reading materials on their own level. 

**Lexile Measure**: A Lexile Measure is a unit of measurement that is used to determine the difficulty of text and the reading level of readers. It is an equal interval scale and can be used to measure growth. 

**Math Facts Screener**: The Math Facts Screener is an indicator of students who may need additional practice building fluency with math facts. There are 2 types of facts screeners in the MI, the Addition Fact Screener and the Multiplication Fact Screener

**Partner Teacher**: A partner teacher is the primary teacher for a FL Student. AmeriCorps members meet with and co-plan for differentiated academic support to achieve catch up growth. 

**Planned Intervention (PI)**: A specific session plan for an individual or group of FL Students to build on foundational skills to achieve catch-up growth

**Quantile Framework**: The Quantile Framework uses Quantile Measures to evaluate students’ readiness for math instruction and the difficulty level of math skills and concepts.

**Quantile Skill and Concept ID (QSCID)**: Quantile Framework is composed of over 500 mathematical skills and concepts or “QSCs” which educators can use to monitor progress and target instruction. Each QSC has a difficulty level that clearly describes how each math skill and/or concept fails along the continuum of math development. This difficulty is referred to as a Quantile measure.

**Skill Focus**: Specific skill in ELA or Math that the AmeriCorps member will target in Planned Intervention over the course of an SSM.

**Student Achievement Manager (SAM)**: Provides tools to generate reports on student performance for the individual, group and team FL.

**Student Support Map (SSM)**: A living document of qualitative and quantitative data on any given FL student to generate strategies for intervention and goal setting. 

**Session Plan (SP)**: A plan for a Planned Intervention session that is developed from the data in the Student Support Map

**Stakeholder**: A person, group or organization that has interest or concern in our organization. This may include AmeriCorps members Partner Teachers, City Year staff, and other school or district staff, etc…

**Tier 2 Support**: Strategic Instruction for FL Students based on MI or RI performance standards. Includes differentiated instruction to build students’ foundational skills
