## Attendance Band

Below you will see a chart that shows the possible absences for each student in each performance in LA Unified. You will notice just like looking at SAM reports you will see the band from _Far Below Basic_ to _Advanced_. 

Ideally you would be choosing students who fall into the _Below Basic_ and _Basic_ band. If you or a partner teacher chooses a student in the _Far Below Basic_ band, talk to your PM first, where they may suggest talking with the Pupil Services and Attendance (PSA) counselor.
