# Adding Session Time 

### Things you **NEED** to fill in is:
- **The Date**: This is the date that you worked with your students.
- **Primary Skills**: This is the skill that you worked on with the student.
	- For Example:
	- Math: Division, Subtraction, Addition, Multiplication, etc.
	- ELA: Comprehension, Reading, Writing, etc.
	- Behavior: Empathy, Social Awareness, Goal Directed Behavior, etc.
- **Comment Section**: This needs to be filled out. This is where you will put the **Comment Code** from your T2ST tracking sheet. 
If you need a reminder of the comment codes you can go back to the [T2ST Logging](t2st.md)
- **Dosage Time**: This is the amount of time you spend working with your student. 

Here is a one pager that can help you through the process.
