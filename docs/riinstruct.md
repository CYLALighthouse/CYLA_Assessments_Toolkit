# RI Instructional Planning Report

This report groups your ELA FL Students according to need, based on their most recent lexile score and performance level.


> [!TIP] **Best Practices** 
> - Create small groups for ELA FL studens with similar lexile scores in order to plan intentional interventions in which multiple students can participate and maximize your T2ST time by providing interventions for multiple students at once.
