## The Math Inventory (MI)

- *What is it:*
	- The *Math Inventory* is a research-based, computer adaptive assessment that measures abilities and longitudinal process from Kindergarten through Algebra II.

- *We use this to:*
	- Determine the students who will be on your Math Focus List (FL)
	- Group FL Students based on common skill gaps
	- Identify specific foundational skills and concepts students are ready to learn, so they might master grade-level content
	- Aligning skills and concpets to CCSS [(Common Core State Standards)](http://www.corestandards.org/read-the-standards/)
	- Partners with [Quantiles.com](https://www.quantiles.com/) to provide resources for Session Plan creation and a self-directed study of Math skills and concepts

!> 	MI is **not timed**. 
	Each student will answer approximately **25-45 questions**.
	Most students take **25-60 minutes** to complete one administration.
	The assessment is computer-adaptive and adjusts question difficulty based on students' responses.


?> **Computer Adaptive Design**		As students progress through the assessment, the difficulty level of questions change according to the students' performance. If the student correctly answers a question, the Lexile measure of the next question increase. If the student incorrectly answers a question, the Lexile measure of the next question decreases. The assessment ends once the student has answered a sufficient number of questions to determine an accurate Lexile measure.

## Test Mechanics 


### Fall MI Performance Bands

- Applied to the first administration of the MI (Baseline Score) 
- Used for Final Focus List Selection

### Spring MI Performance Bands

- Applied to second and third administration of the MI.
- Used as Benchmark for student progress towards grade-level proficiency.

### Average Growth Goals

- The **Average Growth Goal** is an estimate of the amount of quantile growth that an average student (50th percentile) can be expected to grow following a full year of instruction.
- Calculated based on **student grade level** and their **Fall Performance Band**.
- Provides attainable, realistic goals to set with students.
- Serve as the main data point used for:
	- Student Progress Monitoring
	- End of Year Student Outcome
