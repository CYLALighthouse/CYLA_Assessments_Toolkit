# Motivation Check(list)

The HMH website offers research, white papers, and a variety of best practices to better understand the Reading Inventory and Math Inventory. 

- [Interpreting Assessment Results](files/InterpretingAssessmentResults.pdf)
	- Easy to read overview explaining why scores may vary in HMH assessments and best practices to reduce measurement error
- [Accuracy Matters](files/AccuracyMatters.pdf)
	- In-depth, technical manual expanding on the HMH Standardized testing system
- [Meet College and Career Readiness Goals with HMH](files/MeetCollegeandCareerReadiness.pdf)
	- Great resource to share with partner teachers and administration around how HMH can help students and align with Common Core State Standards

## Before the Test

In order for both students and teams to feel prepared to administer and take the HMH, preparation can be done by ACMs, TLs, and PMs to ensure the most optimal test taking enviornment. 

### Logistical Tasks

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### ** ACMs **

- [ ] Have student logins ready
- [ ] Have link to the MI/RI test loaded on computers or accessible easily through other means
- [ ] Ensure that all students have the opportunity to complete the test without feeling rushed. Assign time slots if computers are limited.

#### ** TLs **

- [ ] Familiarize yourself with SAM and test mechanics to answer questions from ACMs 
- [ ] Have link to the MI/RI test loaded on computers or accessible easily through other means


#### ** PMs **

- [ ] Speak with Teachers/Admin to collaborate on best time for testing within CY testing window 
- [ ] Reserve computer lab or lap top cart 
- [ ] Ensure each ACM has received login and password information for students 
- [ ] For MS/HS- create a document to indicate whether teacher would like to keep students out of class for the remainder of testing or create passes for students to return to class. 
- [ ] Have link to the MI/RI test loaded on computers or accessible easily through other means
