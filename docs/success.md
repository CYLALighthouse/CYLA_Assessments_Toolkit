## Before the Test

In order for both students and teams to feel prepared to administer and take the HMH, preparation can be done by ACMs, TLs, and PMs to ensure the most optimal test taking enviornment. 

### Logistical Tasks

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### ** ACMs **

- [ ] Have student logins ready
- [ ] Have link to the MI/RI test loaded on computers or accessible easily through other means
- [ ] Ensure that all students have the opportunity to complete the test without feeling rushed. Assign time slots if computers are limited.

#### ** TLs **

- [ ] Familiarize yourself with SAM and test mechanics to answer questions from ACMs 
- [ ] Have link to the MI/RI test loaded on computers or accessible easily through other means


#### ** PMs **

| Introducing the test to students      | - Why was the student chosen to take the test? <br/> - Why is the test important? <br/> - What will the test results be used for? <br/> - What will happen after the tests? with the results? | My job is to do what I can to support you all in the classroom.In order to support you, I need to know where you all excel, or do really well in, as well as where you all might need a little more help.  One way City Year does this is by giving students a computer-based test. This test helps me identify you are ready to learn in reading or math and shows how I can help you learn and grow as a student.   I’m going to use information to help us select articles and books that will help you grow as a reader (ELA)   I’m going to use this information to help us select skills to focus in math (Math)                                                                                        |
| Logistics (before testing day)        | - When and where are the students taking the test? - What are your expectations of the student?                                                                                               | Share with students when they can expect to take the test and how they are expected to arrive there Example: You are going to take the test this Thursday. I will be picking you up at the end of Period 6. Discuss expectations you have of the student. Example: The test is not timed and it will adjust to your level. That means that there will be some questions that you can answer, and some that might be harder to answer. I expect you to try your hardest so you can show me what you really know and what we might need to work on.                                                                                                                                                             |
| Logistics (day of test)               | - What are the expectations of the testing environment? - What do students need to do during the test? - What procedures do students need to know during the test?                            | Explain expectations of student behavior in the testing room: Example: During the test I expect you to respect yourself and everyone else in the room. Please take the test silently. If you have a problem or a question you should raise your hand. Provide detailed, step-by-step instructions for the students. Components could include: logging into the test, how to communicate if the student has a question of problem, what to do when the student has finished, etc. Prepare yourself to answer any logistical questions about all components of the test. A resource to prepare yourself to guide the student through the test can be found on page #. See: Assessment Action Plan: note catcher |
| Result & Goal Setting (after the test | - What do lexile/quantile scores represent? - How do ACMs share results with students?                                                                                                        | Understand the definitions of Lexile Framework & Quantile Framework so you may translate their meaning to your students. Lexile: This number helps me understand where you are at in reading. It helps us pick texts that are just right for your level, not too hard and not too easy. Quantile: This number helps me understand what you already know and what you are ready to learn in math.
