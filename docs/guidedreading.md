### Guided Reading Strategies

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Before Reading**

- [ ] Activate Prior Knowledge
	- [ ] Using a KWL chart helps connec the student with what they already **Know** (K), what they could be **Wondering** (W), and in the end what they learned from the story/activity.
- [ ] Preview
	- [ ] Previewing the text could look like looking at any of the pictures or titles/subtitles that they could connect what the story may be about. This looks different for all types of readings. 
- [ ] Predict
	- [ ] Making predictions can be tricky so model to them what predicting would look like. Have sentence starters that they could use in case they get stuck. This helps them connect their own experiences to what the text could be about.

#### **During Reading**

- [ ] 'Click and Clunk' 
	- [ ] This is a self-monitor comprehension strategy. This gives the student an opportunity to identify what they are understanding, and where they are getting confused. "Click" would be the things they undertood and "Clunk" would be the things they had confusion about.
- [ ] 'Word Attack'
