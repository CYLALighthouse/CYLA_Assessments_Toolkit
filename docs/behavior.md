### **“If we ask people to look for deficits, they will usually find them, and their view of the situation will be colored by this. If we ask people to look for successes, they will usually find it, and their view of the situation will be colored by this.”** _Kral, 1989_

## Behavior Toolkit

When we think about student academic growth, we have to think about everything that is going on in our student's life. Because we all understand that it is not just their learning modalities but it also includes their _Social Emotional Learning_. By dedicationg time and building out lessons that can essentially help our students beyond the bell. We are showing our belief in the power of young people and giving them the space to be heard by their role model/mentor.

You as the Americorps members, will be facilitating behavior lessons to their behavior students. You will be picking Behavior students after you have filled out the DESSA form for all of your FL students. Head to [DESSA](dessa.md) if you need more information about DESSA and how to get lessons for your Behavior Lesson.

### Picking a Bahavior Focus List

When picking your students for your Focus List, after doing DESSA, you will choose the students who are in the _**Typical**_ band. If you look at the distribution above you can see what scores you will be looking for. Some students will fall between the _Need and Typical_ so you can look for the students who have a **composite score of 35-50 are the ideal candidates for your Behavior Focus List.**

### Behavior Intervention Check-In Check-Out (CICO) Structure and Logistics

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Formal Check-in**

In the first week of when you start Behavior Lessons, you will formally meet with all of your behavior FL students as a small groud and go over what competency you will be working on for the month.
- [ ] Set a monthly goal with each student during the session (individual or as a goup) and discuss how they might be able to achieve that goal over the next three weeks, by making them into smaller goals.
- [ ] Plan this session by filling out the top portion of the Behavior Session Planning Template, referencing [DESSA](dessa.md) and [Clover](clover.md), as well as in class observations.
- [ ] Record the goals on the [SEL Goal Tracker](https://cityyear.sharepoint.com/teams/lax/SitePages/SELgoal.aspx)

#### **Informal Check-in**

The informal check-in's will happen in the middle of the month (week2&3) where you will mainly focus on progress of the goal that your students and yourself made in the first week.
- [ ] What are some challenges they are facing?
- [ ] Where have they seen success? 

#### **Formal Check-out**

The formal check-out should happen at the end of the month where you will discuss how the goal went, and what are some future goals you could make for the following month.
- [ ] Were they successful?
- [ ] If not, what happened?
- [ ] If so, how were the successful?
- [ ] What are some next steps that they could come up with to move to be more successful?
- [ ] What are some goals that they would want to set for themselves next month?

### FAQ's

**What happens if my student is absent for a Behavior CI or a CO?**

- If your student is absent, find the next best opportunity to meet with them for the CI or CO. We
encourage you to keep to the CICO schedule for the month. We understand that sometimes students
are absent or schedules change; utilize your TL to strategize as a thought-partner should you need
support in thinking through a CICO plan.

**Can I carry the monthly goal over of the student did not meet it?**

- We want to set our students up for success and growth so encourage your student to try again with the
same goal. During the formal Check-Out do some reflecting with them on how they might do things
differently to reach the goal. You can circle back round to this in your next formal Check-In at the start
of the following month.
