## Behavior Toolkit

When we think about student academic growth, we have to think about everything that is going on in our student's life. Because we all understand that it is not just their learning modalities but it also includes their _Social Emotional Development_. By dedicationg time and building out lessons that can essentially help our students beyond the bell. We are showing our belief in the power of young people and giving them the space to be heard by their role model/mentor.

You as the Americorps members, will be facilitating behavior lessons to their behavior students. You will be picking Behavior students after you have filled out the DESSA form for all of your FL students. Head to [DESSA](dessa.md) if you need more information about DESSA and how to get lessons for your Behavior Lesson.

### Picking a Bahavior Focus List

When picking your students for your Focus List, after doing DESSA, you will choose the students who are in the _**Typical**_ band. If you look at the distribution above you can see what scores you will be looking for. Some students will fall between the _Need and Typical_ so you can look for the students who have a **composite score of 35-50 are the ideal candidates for your Behavior Focus List.**

### Social-Emotional Development Sessions Structure and Logistics

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Planned Social-Emotional Development Session**

In the first week of when you start Behavior Lessons, you will formally meet with all of your behavior FL students as a small groud and go over what competency you will be working on for the month. If you need more support or review what a [Planned Social-Emotional Development Session](psed.md) visit this sight.

- [ ] Set a monthly goal with each student during the session (individual or as a goup) and discuss how they might be able to achieve that goal over the next three weeks, by making them into smaller goals.

- [ ] Plan this session by filling out the top portion of the Behavior Session Planning Template, referencing [DESSA](dessa.md) and as well as in class observations.

- [ ] Record the goals on the [Planned Social-Emotional Development template](https://cityyear.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/LAX-Staff2/ETuzryKk9ihEsBuxwQ29GisBJSF744ANNt9dX4PqEz7Hvw?e=5Kx7jO&CID=b87c4e0f-81e1-399d-5458-7fd33c821eb1)

#### **Informal Check-in/SED Coaching Conversation**

The informal check-in's can happen spontaneously or can happen while checking in with a student and their goals. This is also known as **SED Coaching Conversations** where you may focus on progress of the goal that your students set for themselves. Sometimes, they can happen during the pulse check of your Planned SED Session. So, be adaptable and take the time to understand that the students can lead a space and want to talk about what is going on.

<!-- ### FAQ's

**What happens if my student is absent for a Behavior CI or a CO?**

- If your student is absent, find the next best opportunity to meet with them for the CI or CO. We
encourage you to keep to the CICO schedule for the month. We understand that sometimes students
are absent or schedules change; utilize your TL to strategize as a thought-partner should you need
support in thinking through a CICO plan.

**Can I carry the monthly goal over of the student did not meet it?**

- We want to set our students up for success and growth so encourage your student to try again with the
same goal. During the formal Check-Out do some reflecting with them on how they might do things
differently to reach the goal. You can circle back round to this in your next formal Check-In at the start
of the following month.

**What Comment Code do I use to log _Informal_ Behavior Check-ins and Check-outs?**

- Any session related to Behavior should be logged as a **B**.
