## Using Data from the Reading Inventory

[Session Plan Blank Template](https://cityyear.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/lax/LandD/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BF465BA47-941F-49B8-AD92-B54EA7E87984%7D&file=FY19%20Session%20Plan%20Template%20Blank.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)

#### Step 1. Group your Students
- The Instructional Planning Report groups your students based on lexile score and performance band. Other things to consider when grouping students are:
	- Will these students work well together?
	- Are you able to work with them at the same time?
	- Will you be able to find an appropriate text based on lexile score that each student can access?

Revisit these groups often to determine if your group dynamics and your students' skill levels are the best fit.

>[!NOTE] See [RI Instructional Planning Report](sam/#ri-instructional-planning-report) or [MI Instructional Planning Report](sam/#mi-instructional-planning-report) summary for more detail.

#### Step 2. Identify a _Reading Related Skill_ to Target with your Partner Teacher
- The [Student Action Report](https://karenmjiang.github.io/CYLA_Assessments_Toolkit/#/sam?id=ri-student-action-reports) will recommend skills to help your students grow as a reader. Other things to consider when identifying a skill to target are:
	- What information have you learned from hearing this student read, and talk about what they have read? (Comprehension, Fluency, Grit when reading)
	- How might the skill you focus on in your sessions, build studentsâ€™ reading comprehension and fluency?
	- Which skill will give students the strategies to be independent readers and learners?

Lexile score tells you the texts that would be the right fit for this student. The Student Action Report, give you recommended skills to target that would help this student become a fluent reader. 

#### Step 3. Connect that skill Focus to a Common Core State Standard Anchor
- Find the Common Core Anchor Standard handout in the [ELA Toolkit](https://cityyear.sharepoint.com/teams/lax/LandD/Student%20Planning%20and%20Progress%20Monitoring/ELA%20Toolkit.pdf)
- Use the skill chosen from the Student Action Report to match with a Guided Reading Strategy, which is connected to a Common Core State Standard (CCSS)
- Identify the CSS that matches the Guided Reading Strategy


#### Step 4. Use the ELA Common Core Anchor Standards Chart to determine the concepts and skills you must teach for students to master that CCSS

#### Step 5. Find resources from the ELA Toolkit, to use as you plan your sessions

#### Step 6. Determine the Lexile Range of text You Will Use
