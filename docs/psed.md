# Planned Social-Emotional Development

Planned Social Emotional Development is supporting students with behavior deficits. These are based off of the DESSA Assessments that ACM's submit on all of their Focus List students and based on Observations inside and outside of the classroom. This is a space that an ACM provides for students to intentionally work on behavior skills. By reviewing the particular skill, doing an honest reflection, and goal setting. 

## Planned SED Session

### Select a SED Skills

This is an intentional plan to work on a behavior skill that a student needs support in. After reviewing DESSA Assessments and reviewing Student Observations, ACM's will first select a skill focus to work on for that week. Below are the SED Skills listed.

- Self-Management
- Social Awareness
- Self-Awareness
- Decision Making
- Personal Responisibility
- Relationship Skills
- Optimistic Thinking
- Goal-Directed Behavior

Once the ACM has selected a SED Skill that they will be working on with the student/s. They will then begin the session with their student starting with a PULSE Check.

### Pulse Check

This is a way to check in with the student/s to see how they are doing. This could look like a PIES Check-in. Or simply asking how are they doing. This will give the ACM a feeling of how the student is coming into the space. This is how the ACM will guage with the student and see how the session will continue. ***It is ok, if the session gets pushed and this session becomes a SED Check-in. Just move the session to the following week and support the student with their feelings.***

### Warm Up

Once the Session is started with a Pulse Check, move forward with a Warm Up. The Warm Up is a space that will start off the session. It can be a fun activity, a game, or even listening to music to pull the student into the session, and build some community if the session involves other students.

### SED Competencies Objective Review

The next piece of this session, is reviewing the SED Competencites Objectives. This is a space to explain to the student what they will be learning or practicing. So, intentionally think about how the session can be explained to different students, at different grade levels.

The next piece of the session, is the Activity Connected to SED Competencies. This is a space that can be as creative as you want.

### Activity Connected to SED Competencies

The activity can be focused on the student/s interests and areas of strengths to build on. Review some examples of activities below. 

If you need more support with reviewing strategies go to the [Aperture Site](https://sel.datalinkevo.com/#/strategies/resources).

Once the activity is picked and facilitated, the student will then go through the most important pieces. Reflection and Goal Setting.

### Reflection

This piece gives the student an opportunity to reflect on the progress of their goal/s or give them some time to reflect how the skill from the activity can be used inside the classroom and outside. Give them a space where they feel comfortable to write down in a journal, and shareout to the ACM and/or small group. Whatever feels best for the student/s and their needs.

If you are stuggling with thinking up different reflection questions visit this [edutopia](https://www.edutopia.org/sites/default/files/resources/edutopia-stw-replicatingpbl-21stcacad-reflection-questions.pdf). It has great example reflection questions to support your student/s.

### Goal Setting

Goal Setting is a piece that either the student can create their own goals or the ACM can support the student in creating their goal. This is not a space for ACM's to tell the student/s what they should try or what their goal **should** be but a space to brainstorm with the student in creating an achievable goal. Goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and timely.

This space should be giving power to the student/s. This is a space to review past goals and see what they can do to either achieve them in the following week or what they can adjust to make it more attainable. 

Make this space safe and neutral. Use phrases like ***"I am wonder if you might try... insert idea,... you shared that..."*** 

*Goal setting is super important. Take your time to go through the Reflection and Goal Setting.* 

### When to Reconnect

Before closing out the space make sure to communicate to the student/s when the next session will be. Have them make a reminder, give them a ticket with a time and day, be creative when exiting this space. Remind them that before the next session to do some reflection on how their goals went.
