# Planned Social-Emotional Development

Planned Social Emotional Development is supporting students with behavior deficits. These are based off of the DESSA Assessments that ACM's submit on all of their Focus List students and based on Observations inside and outside of the classroom. This is a space that an ACM provides for students to intentionally work on behavior skills. By reviewing the particular skill, doing an honest reflection, and goal setting. 

### Planned SED Session

This is an intentional plan to work on a behavior skill that a student needs support in. After reviewing DESSA Assessments and reviewing Student Observations, ACM's will first select a skill focus to work on for that week. Below are the SED Skills listed.

- Self-Management
- Social Awareness
- Self-Awareness
- Decision Making
- Personal Responisibility
- Relationship Skills
- Optimistic Thinking
- Goal-Directed Behavior

Once the ACM has selected a SED Skill that they will be working on with the student/s. They will then begin the session with their student starting with a PULSE Check.

This is a way to check in with the student/s to see how they are doing. This could look like a PIES Check-in. Or simply asking how are they doing. This will give the ACM a feeling of how the student is coming into the space. This is how the ACM will guage with the student and see how the session will continue. ***It is ok, if the session gets pushed and this session becomes a SED Check-in. Just move the session to the following week and support the student with their feelings.***

Once the Session is started with a Pulse Check, move forward with a Warm Up. The Warm Up is a space that will start off the session. It can be a fun activity, a game, or even listening to music to pull the student into the session, and build some community if the session involves other students.

The next piece of this session, is reviewing the SED Competencites Objectives. This is a space to explain to the student what they will be learning or practicing. So, intentionally think about how the session can be explained to different students, at different grade levels.

The next piece of the session, is the Activity Connected to SED Competencies. This is a space that can be as creative as you want,
