# Creating Session Plans

Step 1: Download SP file

Step 2: Fill out the top portion of the Session Plan file:
	- Students

	- ACM

	- DESSA Focus 

Step 3: Write what CCSS Standard that you will be targeting for this session. This will be the standard that you obtained from the SAM report that you would want to focus on for the nest 6 weeks.

Step 4: Create the Learning Objective for the day. This is the main lesson that you will be teaching your student(s). 

Step 5: List out the materials and how you would want the room to be set up for your particular group. This may be different for each group considering the modalities and DESSA strengths and weaknesses.

Step 6: Fill out the Opening portion of the Session Plan. 
	- Soft Check-in: This can be a temperature check, a weather check, etc. This can be anything that you have learned from previous sessions.
	
	- Expectations: These are the expectations that you and your students set for your sessions. 

	- Warm-up: You want to include a light warm-up for your session that will help ground them to the lesson. Most likely realting to the topic of your lesson. If you are doing a math lesson have them do a math warm-up. If you are doing an ELA lesson you should be doing a ELA warm-up.


This is how you create a list:
- Bullet
- Bullet
	- Sub Bullet 1
	- Sub Bullet 2
- Bullet


This is how you **bold**.

This is how you _italicize_.
