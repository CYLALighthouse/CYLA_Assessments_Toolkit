# Planned Academic Coaching

## Planned Academic Coaching (PAC)

 Planned academic Coaching is an intentionally planned 15-30-minute Academic Intervention. It is an intervention that centers on grade-level **Class** content and *leverages* effective instructional strategies and a provided session template.  It is also known as ***Catch Up Tutoring***.

## Elements of High-Quality Instruction
<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Learning Objectives**

A learning objective is a specific skill that your student/s should be able to achieve by the end of an instructional period.

- [ ] ex: **Math** "Students will be able to understand the concept of multiplication by utilizing repeated addition."
- [ ] ex: **ELA** "Students will be able to understand a reading passage by annotating pieces of a passage at a time."

#### **Activating Prior Knowledge**

Activating prior knowledge is like warming up before exercising or playing a sport. This includes both eliciting from students what they already know and building initial knowledge that they need to access upcoming content.

- [ ] ex: **Math** "Our warm up will be reviewing and making sure we understand how to add two numbers together. We will be playing a game to warm up."
- [ ] ex: **ELA** "We will be going over vocab words that the student/s should know. If not, reviewing any vocab words that is in the assignment and taking notes on the margin of the passage."

#### **Gradual Release of Responsibility (I Do, We Do, You Do)**

The gradual release of responsibility is a way of designing a lesson so that the learning activity ownership starts mostly with the AmeriCorps member and, over time, transfers to the students, like passing them the baton of learning ownership. 

- [ ] I Do: The "I Do" portion will be the ACM modeling how to solve a problem or taking notes during a reading. Make sure the ACM is utilizing the particular skill they are intentionally planning with the student/s.
- [ ] We Do: The "We Do" portion will be letting the student take over the assignment but the ACM will still be there to provide any support. This could look like the student asking questions or course correcting. ***Please know that it is ok to go back to the "I Do" if the student needs another model. This also could be helpful for students who have a visual learning modality.***
- [ ] You Do: The "You Do" portion will be the student taking full control of the assignment. The ACM will give no support. And allow the student to practice on their own. Once the assignment is completed, the ACM and student will review the work and see what the next steps will be, or answer any questions that the student is still struggling with. ***Just like the "We Do" it is ok, after reviewing their work, to try another problem together.***


#### **Checks for Understanding**

Checking for understanding is how we know whether students are on track to achieve the learning objective. Checks for Understanding is something that should be done in each step of the **Gradual Release Process**. 

This could look as simple as asking a question about the process, to creating a exercise beforehand for the student to practice. 

#### **Differentiation**

Differentiation is how we personalize support for students to ensure they each have an equitable opportunity to achieve the learning objective, like staggering starting lines or using different lanes to navigate a track. 

Remember that all students learn differently and may even be at different levels. Here are some examples to look out for when trying to differentiate your approach with your students:

- [ ] Modalities: Modalities are ways people learn.
	- [ ] Visual Learners: People learn better when they can see the process and how each step is performed
	- [ ] Auditory Learners: People who like to listen to the lesson, or recite the information. Could also be asking frequent questions to gain a better understanding
	- [ ] Reading/Writing Learners: People who need undisrupted time away from people or just need to work it out alone. They need time to read the assignment and analyze after to learn what they read. 
	- [ ] Kinesthetic Learners: People who need to be physically doing the assignment. They learn best by doing or by experiencing the lesson.
- [ ] Performance Levels: Performance Levels is reviewing what the student knows and what level can elevate their learning without discoraging them with something that is too hard.
- [ ] Social-Emotional Development: Thinking about how you work with this student. What are they experiencing? How are they coming to your space? Can they work with others? What is the space you are providing them? Think about these questions when you are working with your students and how it best suit to their needs.

## Session Planning 

#### [Planned Academic Coaching Session Plan Template](https://cityyear-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/cjarret_cityyear_org/EQ59IfWG55xDsu9LxNV84z8B75PCQjBptErctLmJpxKyIg?e=IH7Inf)

The purpose of the Session Planning Template is to support ACMs in meaningfully planning out their academic interventions with students.  Think of this Session Plan as a guide; however, you can also feel free to adapt the session plan as need (with consultation from your PM) based on your specific studentsâ€™ needs and your school context.
