# DESSA

The **Devereux Students Strengths Assessment (DESSA)**

DESSA is an assessment that all teams will need to perform. It is an assessment that you fill out for all of your SED Focus List students. This assessment will ask you relevant questions about your student behavior inside the classroom and outside the classroom. 

DESSA is a good tool to inform you on who would make a great SED FL student.

# DESSA Strategies

When it comes down to coming up with lessons for your students, always remember you do not have to reinvent the wheel. On the DESSA home page, you can look up strategies/lessons that you can use for your students. Remember, they are templates for your to use, you still need to add your student(s) specific needs. Please follow the steps below to get to the lessons.

- This is the page that you go to to log in to fill out your DESSA reports. So go ahead and sign in.

- You will be able to pick any of the eight DESSA competencies and the page will come with lessons/strategies that you can use for your interventions. Below is the usual layout of the page.

- It usually has a "Teacher Reflection and Action" template, some universal templates, small groups, and even individual templates that you can use. If you have a parent that would like some lessons for the student to do at home there is even a template for them to take home near the bottom of the page.

For example, if I chose _Self Awareness_, like I did in the picture, and I were facilitating a Behavior Lesson Plan I would click on _A Time I Helped_. It will pop up a pdf that has the lesson already built out for me. I would read through the entire lesson and modify it for my student and make sure that it suits them the best it can. 

The lesson looks something like this...

I hope this helps.
