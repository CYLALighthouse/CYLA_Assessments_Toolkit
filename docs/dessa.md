# DESSA

The **Devereux Students Strengths Assessment (DESSA)**

DESSA is an assessment that all teams will need to perform. It is an assessment that you fill out for all of your SED Focus List students. This assessment will ask you relevant questions about your student behavior inside the classroom and outside the classroom. 

DESSA is a good tool to inform you on who would make a great SED FL student.

- You will be able to select a DESSA competency and then select grade level to access  lessons/strategies that you can use for SED sessions. Below is the layout of the page.

- It usually has a "Teacher Reflection and Action" template, some universal templates, small groups, and even individual templates that you can use. If you have a parent that would like some lessons for the student to do at home, there are also templates for them to take home near the bottom of the page.

For example, if I chose _Self Awareness_, like I did in the picture, and I were facilitating an SED Lesson Plan I would click on _My Successes and Challenges_. It will open a pdf that has the lesson already built out for me. I would read through the entire lesson and modify it for my student. 

The lesson looks something like this...
