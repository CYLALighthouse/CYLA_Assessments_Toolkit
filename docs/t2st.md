### Using the T2ST Tracker

The most important piece that must be filled out is the comment code. This helps differentiate the type of environment and lesson you facilitated to your students. Whether it was Academic Coaching (AC) or Planned Academic Coaching (PAC) and a Socio-Emotional Development check-ins (SED) or a Planned Socio-Emotional Development (PSED). Look below to figure out the difference.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Academic Coaching**

- [ ] Academic Coaching will be coded as **AC**. 
- [ ] Academic Coaching is when you are tutoring your student with work that may have been given by your partner teacher or you are playing a game that relates to which Focus List your student is on. 

#### **Planned Academic Coaching**

- [ ] Planned Intervention will be coded as **PAC**.
- [ ] Planned Intervention is when you have created a lesson for your student that fits all their needs. Please review [Planned Acadmic Coaching](pac.md) for more support.
	- [ ] This includes their DESSA needs, modalities, and their standard that you picked for them. 

#### **Socio-Emotional Development Check-in**

- [ ] Socio-Emotional Development Check-in will be coded as **SED**
- [ ] Socio-Emotional Development Check-ins are check-ins with students and seeing how they are doing. This could be a goals check-in and seeing how they are doing with their goals, maybe need to adjust or brainstorm new ideas to help achieve them.

#### **Planned Socio-Emotional Development Sessions**

- [ ] Planned Socio-Emotional Development Sessions will be coded as **PSED**
- [ ] Planned Socio-Emotional Development Sessions are intentional sessions that will support in a students SED growth. Please review [Planned SED Sessions](psed.med) for more support.

> [!NOTE] The main difference to remember between Academic Coaching and Planned Academic Coaching is when doing a Planned Intervention, it is something that you planned specifically to your student(s) needs to help them grow. Whereas, Academic Coaching is something that was given to your student at their grade level.

### Comment Codes

There are different comment codes that you will have to use when counting your time. 

> [!WARNING] **Spelling** and **Puntuation** is important when logging into CYSchoolhouse. On your tracker you should make a habit in spelling the code correctly and making sure that it is all caps. That way when you log the minutes, the comment code is already spelled and punctuated correctly when you go to backlog. 

| Comment Code 	|               | Comment Code Meaning |
|------------|---------------|---------------|
| AC    		| :arrow_right: | Academic Coaching           |
| PAC   		| :arrow_right: | Planned Academic Coaching |
| SED  		| :arrow_right: | Socio-Emotional Development   |
| PSED			| :arrow_right:	| Planned Socio-Emotional Development |

> [!NOTE] You should be marking down on your tracker everytime you finish a lesson or stop a lesson with a student. This will help make sure the exact amount of time is documented and what subject you were working on with your student. This is a good habit to have to make sure that you have accurate data.
