### Using the T2ST Tracker

The most important piece that must be filled out is the comment code. This helps differentiate the type of environment and lesson you facilitated to your students. Whether it was Academic Coaching (AC) or Planned Intervention (PI) and even if it were a one on one (1) or a small group (SG). Look below to figure out the difference.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Academic Coaching**

- [ ] Academic Coaching will be coded as **AC**. 
- [ ] Academic Coaching is when you are tutoring your student with work that may have been given by your partner teacher or you are playing a game that relates to which Focus List your student is on. 

#### **Planned Intervention**

- [ ] Planned Intervention will be coded as **PI**.
- [ ] Planned Intervention is when you have created a lesson for your student that fits all their needs. 
	- [ ] This includes their DESSA needs, modalities, and their standard that you picked for them.

> [!NOTE] The main difference to remember between Academic Coaching and Planned Intervention is when doing a Planned Intervention, it is something that you planned specifically to your student(s) needs to help them grow. Whereas, Academic Coaching is something that was given to your student at their grade level.

### Comment Codes

There are different comment codes that you will have to use when counting your time. 

> [!WARNING] **Spelling** and **Puntuation** is important when logging into CYSchoolhouse. On your tracker you should make a habit in spelling the code correctly and making sure that it is all caps. That way when you log the minutes, the comment code is already spelled and punctuated correctly when you go to backlog.

> [!NOTE] You should be marking down on your tracker everytime you finish a lesson or stop a lesson with a student. This will help make sure the exact amount of time is documented and what subject you were working on with your student. This is a good habit to have to make sure that you have accurate data.
